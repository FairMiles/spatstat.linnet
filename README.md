The original `spatstat` package has been split into several sub-packages.

This package `spatstat.linnet` is one of the sub-packages. 
It contains the subset of the functionality of `spatstat`
that deals with linear networks. This includes
plotting, geometrical operations, data analysis,
statistical modelling, and simulation.

The reorganisation of `spatstat` into a family of packages is described
on the GitHub repository
[spatstat/spatstat](https://github.com/statstat/spatstat).
