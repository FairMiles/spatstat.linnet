# spatstat.linnet

This is a subset of the original `spatstat` package.

The original `spatstat` package is still available
at its [CRAN page](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/spatstat)
or at [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/spatstat/spatstat).

The original `spatstat` package is currently being split into
several sub-packages.

This package `spatstat.linnet` is one of the sub-packages. 
It contains the subset of the functionality of spatstat
that deals with linear networks.
